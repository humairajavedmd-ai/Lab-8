# VV-Lab-SP24-BSSE-077-PSVS

Verification & Validation lab repository for the **Polar Seed Vault System (PSVS)**.

- **Student:** Humaira Javed
- **Roll No:** SP24/BSSE/077/B
- **Course:** Verification & Validation (Lab)

## Scenario
A polar vault stores sealed boxes of crop seeds deposited by registered institutions. Each box holds one species. The vault has several freezer chambers; staff handle deposits, withdrawals and monitoring. Depositors own their boxes and the vault is only the custodian.

## Repository structure
| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| /requirements | Informal requirements S1-S12 (baseline PSVS-REQ-v1.0) |
| /defect-logs | Defect taxonomy and defect log |
| /abstractions | Abstract data types and state abstractions (later tasks) |
| /models | Formal models (later tasks) |
| /operations | Operation specifications (later tasks) |
| /constraints | Invariants and constraints (later tasks) |
| /proofs | Proof obligations and proofs (later tasks) |
| /reports | Summary tables, charts, peer review, change-request template |

## Configuration management
- `main` holds the accepted baselines. Tag **baseline-1** marks commit **PSVS-REQ-v1.0** (S1-S12).
- Work on defect analysis is done on branch `defect-analysis` and merged into `main` with `--no-ff`.
- Changes to baselined artifacts go through `reports/change-request-template.md`.

## Task 1 and 2 deliverables
| Deliverable | File |
|---|---|
| Baseline requirements | requirements/PSVS-REQ-v1.0.md |
| Change-request template | reports/change-request-template.md |
| Taxonomy | defect-logs/defect-taxonomy.md |
| Defect log | defect-logs/defect-log.csv (and .md) |
| Peer-review comparison | reports/peer-review-comparison.md |
| Summary and chart | reports/defect-summary.md, reports/defects-by-category-severity.png |
